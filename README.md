# OnlineBhamTimetableConverter
Will automatically add your bham timetable to a google calendar and email you a link that gives you control permission over it.

To get this to work you may need to change a few string where I mention `bham.timetable@gmail.com` and you will be asked to authorise this with your google account through the google api. I recoomend making a new google account for this project to create calendars and emails with. You will need to create a new project through the google API dashboard and add its `credentials.json` file to the root directory of this project.

At the moment you can run the `BhamCalConverter.py` file to be emailed a google calendar link.
